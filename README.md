# Simplitrac Frontend

## Setup
1. Once you have cloned the repo, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. You need to create a .env file in your root folder (the simplitrac_frontend folder). Your firestore key needs to be in here
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Click the link in the terminal to open the project in your browser.

## Writing code in dev
1. When you are writing code in development, you want to make sure that you have your IDE open and the web browser open at the same time
2. As you make changes in your IDE, you should see them reflected in your browser. 
3. As soon as something breaks, you CTRL + Z to undo whatever you did to break things.

That's how you do it.
